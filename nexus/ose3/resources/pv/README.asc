== Configure Persistence Volume for Nexus
Nexus-persistent image will require a Peristent-Volume called *nexus-pv*, of type ReadWriteOnce.

You can create a hostPath or NFS easily, using one of the provided examples. 

NOTE: Remember that not any user can use a hostPath mount, so you need to grant the user the ability to mount hostPath PV by adding it to the
hostmount SCC. As DC run by default with ServiceAccount *default* you'll need to grant that ServiceAccount the ability or a ServiceAccount provided by the DC.
